App name: Budget University
App Tagline: This app tracks the spendings in different categories

link to the api: https://github.com/Rikako11/BudgetUniversityAPI.git


IOS: Use the UIcollectionView and TableView
Other: I am so sorry my whole workspace dissaspeared on the submission date so I recreated the whole ios app thing by myself in 6 hrs : ( I did not have enough time to finish all the network calls but I managed to recreated the view roughly (sad face

Also due to the issue within the api, the table view is not updating correctly but there is api calls for that
